# Fit4U
Project description: This application will give users the opportunity to be able to them the infotmation of the amount of calories they will need to accomplish their fitness goals and to ensure they are intaking the correct amount of calories.

Problem addressing: Application will help users who do not know where to start when it comes to achieving a fitness goal, such as losing weight, Maintaining weight, or gaining muscle. This Application will be great for beginners who have just recently started their fitness journey and want to find a easy metric that will give them information on the amount of calories they will need based off the options they choose from.

Platform: Android Studio will be the main development tool for the creation of this application. Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every Android device and can give me the neccessary tools I will need to be able to launch my application.

Front/Back end support: I will be using Android Studio for the front and backend support. Android Studio XML will be utilized to create layout views for my application to give it the most user friendly interface for a common person. I will ensure that it's very easy and simple to use so anyone from over the ages of 16 can utilize. The backend support I will be using is java to ensure that all information are calculated correctly and everything is calculated to the best caloric standards based off the information that was entered in the interface.

Functionality: User's will enter the information that the application is asking for and it will give the user the daily caloric range for each goal, depending on which goal you are wanting to accomplish.

Design (wireframes) : To design my wireframes, I hand drawn it first then I used Justinmind to create a wireframe online to get a better visual to see how my app will possibly look with the creation of my designs.

#Update

I've completed 3 of my screens with the completion of my Welcome screen for my FIT4U application. I completed the screen for the user to have the opportunity to enter their information. I'm still working on ensuring the application retrieves the information the user inputted. My third screen is the screen the user will choose the activity level they believe that is mostly the activity level on the day to day basis. I will work on next to ensure the application is able to calculate the information the end user inputs to the desired results of the calories they need to eat to achieve their fitness goals,
